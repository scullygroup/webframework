h1. WebFramework Base

This simple codebase creates a basic, startup skeleton for creating an average website.
It includes directories for all stages of planning, design, and development.
Also, it will create an initial git repository for you with all initial files added and committed.

It sets-up the following directory structure:
<pre><code>
  |____audio
  |____copy
  |____flash
  |____graphics
  | |____fonts
  | |____images
  | |____logos
  | |____mockups
  |____planning
  |____site
  | |____.git
  | |____images
  | |____index.php
  | |____scripts
  | | |____base.js
  | | |____jquery.metadata.js
  | | |____jquery.validate.js
  | | |____rollovers.js
  | | |____swfobject.js
  | |____styles
  | | |____ie7.css
  | | |____reset.css
  | | |____style.css
  | |____swf
  |____video
</pre></code>

h1. Installation and Set-Up

Grab this git project and place it in your desired working directory by issuing the following command (replacing YOURDIRECTORY with whatever you want to name your working directory):
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/scullygroup/webframework.git YOURDIRECTORY</code></pre>

Next, cd into your working directory and run the skeleton.sh shell script from within your working directory like so:
<pre><code>
  cd YOURDIRECTORY
  sh ./skeleton.sh
  </code></pre>

The shell script will create most of the directories outlined previously, as well as download these javascript files and supporting assets:
*jquery.metadata.js
*jquery.validate.js
*swfobject.js

jQuery and jQuery Tools are also referenced in index.php from a CDN service.
